# PostgreSQL Core Practice
This repository demonstrates hands-on PostgreSQL database engineering concepts through a structured, schema-driven relational design.

## Domain
A simple academic management system used to model:
- Students
- Courses
- Enrollments
- Performance tracking

## Focus Areas
- Schema design and naming conventions
- Table normalization
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Sample data loading
- Query correctness and clarity

## Repository Structure
schemas/   → schema creation scripts  
tables/    → table definitions with constraints  
data/      → controlled sample data  
queries/   → example SQL queries  

## How to Run
1. Create a fresh PostgreSQL database
2. Execute scripts in the following order:
   - schemas
   - tables
   - data
   - queries

## Status
This repository will be expanded with:
- Indexing
- Transactions
- Performance analysis
